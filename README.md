## Changes
Added notes to what is necessary for this to work inside of a manually mapped driver, and describes why it only works in the IOCTL handler.
The notes can be located in window_hijack\includes\dispatch\control.cpp.

Gist including all necessary code to wrap and run ValidateHwnd: https://gist.github.com/juniorjacob/7db2b91847eca8cc870c75c224fe9e0b.

## Usage
To use the project as-is:

1. Enable test-signing mode
2. Compile in Release x64
3. Load the driver using any traditional driver loader
4. Start window_hijack_cli using the following pattern: `window_hijack_cli.exe [window_class_name]`
